$ mmon
```

Press `q` (quit) or `CTRL-c` to exit mmon.

## Features

<img src="https://www.plus-innovations.com/images/micro-monitor-1-1-0.png" alt="mmon screenshot">

- current CPU load
- current MEM usage
- file system usage (overall and per mount)
- file system stats (R/W per second, IOPS)
- network stats (rx, tx per second)
- \# network connections
- \# processes
- top processes
- users online
- [docker][docker-url] containers

I tested it on several Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu distributions, inside Docker
containers as well as OS X (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Captain, Sierra, High
Sierra, Mojave, Catalina) and Windows 10.

This CLI tool depends on the [systeminformation][systeminformation-url] npm
package that I wrote. Have a look at it, if you are interested.

## Command Line Options

**Set interval**

The default update interval is 2 seconds but you can change it easily: the
following command line option sets it to 5 seconds:

```
mmon -i 5
```
